## 1. 
## 1.  S3 bucket on AWS 
The data is uploaded by me after receiving zipped data from the client. If the data sources are multiple or they are too large to be shared via email or secure ftp then you would need to manage the S3 bucket on your end and just grant me user access. If I manage the bucket, I would create a seperate bucket specifically for working with you and add the monthly costs to your invoice as a seperate line. [Here is some pricing info,](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=4) it primarily depends on the size of the data.
