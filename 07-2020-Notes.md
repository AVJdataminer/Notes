Explaination for Box Cox transformations:
We apply the jarque_bera and normal tests help indicate to us if the Boxcox transformation resulted in a normal distribution. As with all statistical testing the results can be considered significant if the p-value is less than a specified alpha level, which is most commonly 0.05. Therefore, you can see the results of applying the transformation only resulted in statistically normal distributions some of the time and not in all cases. If the p-value for both the jarque_bera and the normal test are larger than 0.05 (such as 0) we can assume the transformation did not result in normally disti


Notebook validation error came up again in Github Issues
Fix involves opening the JSON code and replacing the null values with a number.
Steps:
1. Checkout a new branch
2. Make a copy of notebook and name as _old
3. Rename original with txt
4. Open in texteditor
5. Search and Replace null exceution counts with numbers
6. save as ipynb
7. commit
8. push
9. 
`Execution_count : null` needs to be replaced with number in sequence. ![See example.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22673372/34918411-0f221e12-f907-11e7-9b39-f1ac25b0fb81.png)

### Thinkful Notes
[Carry over qualified example](https://www.qualified.io/hire/assessments/5efa52858d5f2a000d3c8ddc?q=Classification%20Problems%20-%20Building%20and%20Analyzing%20Multi-Class%20Classifiers)
- To add images to Q & A challenge you need to drag them into the image prompt.
- [x] Ask John if the location he saves the images is a shared location I can use for markdwon referenced images?
- Copied the [Data Distributions question](https://www.qualified.io/hire/assessments/5edd26fd94c6ea000f8538e8?q=dist) for recreating t-test question and it still looks blank from the outside.
- For Assessment summary: 
- ## In this Assessment, we will evaluate your proficiency with data distributions using Python.
- ## When you are done with the Assessment, you can check your answers by looking in this folder:

### Meeting with John for Thinkful
- Add a solution md file in a new directory use `working with numbers` as an example.
- For sequential carryover questions, each answer should contain all prior answers.
- The `test_submission.py` should be hidden or Read/Write and is not visible to the student
- The `test_solution.py` is visible to the student and should not contain anything to give away the answers
- In the `solution.py` Answer Key add the author thinkful email as the contact info
- 

Thinkful Qualified Assessments that need solution files added:
- [ ] [Python-Dictionaries](https://www.qualified.io/hire/assessments/5ef3acabc075cb001029d1fd/edit/challenges?q=dictio)

Check on Central Limit theorem checkpoint Assessment as well.

- [ ] Rename the functions assessment [here](https://www.qualified.io/hire/assessments/5e9b2e898f452d001cb84143)
- [ ] Add another function challenge to the assessment for functions
- [ ] Add the checkpoint number to the name like JOhn's
- [ ] Add the proper airtable labels to the Assessment
- [ ] Double check the t-test assessment and why it looks blank
- [ ] Rename [t-test assessment](https://www.qualified.io/hire/assessments/5eece382a668fb000de1494b?q=t%20test) to match check point name and add some multiple choice questions
