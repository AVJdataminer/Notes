> #### 1. Deadlifts 
It’s important to avoid this and keep the spine in a straight neutral position, otherwise you run the risk of harming your spinal discs.

Also, don’t be afraid to add a decent amount of weight to your deadlifts. Beginners should start with a weight they can lift for roughly 6 to 8 repetitions.

1.  To begin, start with the bar on the floor, with your feet halfway beneath the bar at hip-width.
2.  Bend forward and grab the bar, palms facing down, arms about shoulder-width apart just outside the legs.
3.  Bend your knees until your shins touch the bar.
4.  Lift your chest, keeping your back straight, and avoid dropping your hips.
5.  Grasp the bar as you stand up fully, holding the bar against your legs. Avoid shrugging or leaning back at the top.
6.  Return the weight to the floor by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
7.  Repeat.
#### 2. Lateral Lunges
Lateral lunges target the calves, glutes, and hamstrings, as well as the inner thighs. Add dumbbells to this exercise for extra burn.

**How to Perform Lateral Lunges:**

1.  Begin by standing with feet hip-width apart, dumbbells at your sides.
2.  Making sure to point your knee in the same direction as your foot, take a large step to the right, keeping the dumbbells at your sides.
3.  Push back and lower your hips until your thighs are parallel to the floor, keeping your knees behind your toes and your spine straight.
4.  Return to your starting position using your glutes and hamstrings.
5.  Repeat, alternating sides, for 6 to 8 reps on each leg.
#### 3. Hip Thrusts
7. Hip thrusts are one of the best exercises for sculpting the glutes and the backside. They can often be lost in the shadows of squats, deadlifts, and lunges, but are truly an exercise everyone looking to sculpt the back of their legs should perform.

Not only are they superb glute sculptors, they can even improve your deadlifts and squats due to fuller extension in the hips (which maximizes the engagement of the glutes).

**How to Perform the Hip Thrust:**

1.  Begin with a low bench and your barbell, placing the bench pad just below you shoulder blades and the barbell across your upper thighs.
2.  Place your feet directly under your knees and keep your neck neutral.
3.  Engage your glutes as you thrust your hips upward until your thighs are parallel to the ground, squeezing your glute muscles to make sure they are engaged.
4.  Return to starting position, aiming for 6 to 8 reps.
