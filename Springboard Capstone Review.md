**Summary**

Great job! You completed a capstone project with sufficient breadth and depth to demonstrate data science skills presented in the course, including skills in programming, exploratory data analysis, and communication of the project process. Additionally, this is a cohesive project that is ready to be utilized as a core part of your professional portfolio.
  

**Completion**

Your submission is complete and includes all requested pieces including:

- The submission includes code for the project, submitted as a Jupyter notebook in your Github repository.

- The submission includes a 11 page slide deck presentation submitted as pdf document. This presentation combines thorough descriptions and well planned out data visualizations to provide a solid overview of the modeling outcomes and potential considerations by users.

- The submission includes a 9-page report submitted as a pdf on the Github repo and is based on all previous project submissions. You created a report that is very well constructed and that most readers can follow regardless of their technical abilities. Nice work on this.

- All intermediate capstone steps submissions are complete and any concerns or discrepancies you addressed.

  

**Understanding and Process**

You successfully identified an audience of team managers and owners and those involved in monitoring clean water supplies in general. The data utilized in the project shows an understanding of how to acquire via url pull, wrangle, and clean very messy data. Data sets were well-chosen and relevant to the problem; including selecting a subset a measured constituents at each site and then also identifying six keystone sites for your complete analysis. You successfully stepped through the process of data wrangling, EDA, feature creation and feature selection, model development, and model selection. More discussion on how many features were included in the final model would have been helpful. Based on the figure in your report only a subset of somewhere between 10-15 features should have been included in your final model for that scenario.

  

**Presentation**

The slide deck presents the motivations and recommendations clearly and impact fully, utilizing visuals. Perhaps create two slides for the EDA work; there is alot of information on the one slide. The takeaways slide is quite helpful and wraps all the finer points up nicely.
