## Meeting with Yash at [AntWak](https://www.antwak.com/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=principlebutton)
- Seed funded for $1 Million +
- Started in Sept 2019
- Focusing on experience of an individual instead of technical skills like in Cousersa
- Social platform like Khan Academy but with experts with 10 plus years experience
- 7 countries, 450 professionals
- channels
	- sales & marketing
	- digital trans
	- data sci and AI
	- plus more
Also 3 vertical channels
- women, mental health, soft skill

Why better than youtube - recruiting experts in a domain that are not on youtube
kind of video platform like quora
Revenue genertation
based on shorter videos - set up 
Team makes 20-25 topics that will provide ahead of time and pick topics or add topics
60 -75 minute time for interview, a few retakes for some topics, 7-10 days for post production work
break into multiple 3-4 minute videos, after approval from me the content it gets added
I can market and share the content as I please with AntWak
Following interaction requests for 1-on-1 the 30% platform and 70% to expert

Linear Regression 
R-squared values 
RIdge Regression and SVM with 97%, because 97% of data was bewteen 35-39 weeks.
Random Forest
AdaBoost 
Catboost with absolute error of 1week

moved to classification
SVM
RF with 92% 
Catboost with imbalance adjustment with weights improved recall to minimize false negatives

Working on the T-test checkpoint
Potential general parts:
- The Central limit theorem is what allows for the statistical extension of an outcome from a sample to a population
- The null hypothesis: the mean of group 1 is not different than the mean of group 2.
- The alternative to the null: mean1 -mean2 !=0, therefore they are equal.
- Using the independent samples t-test to falsify the null hypothesis, i.e. reject the null hypothesis
- Assumptions of the t-test: 
	- 1. the test variable is continuous
	- 2. observation indepence, the value of one measurement does not affect another
	- 3. Samples are randomly drawn for each population
	- 4. The test variables sample and populations are approximately normally distributed.
	- 5. Sample sizes are large enough to be representative of the population
	- 6. variances are equal in both the sample and the population.
Steps for t-test:
1. Establish normality
	2. Visually with a histogram
	3. descriptive statistics or inferential statistics
2. Compare a test statistic (t-statistic) to a critical value
	3. t-statistic is calculated with the sample means, size, and standard deviations
3. Comparing the confidence interval with alpha
4.
